### Project Description :

1. A Java Swing application called the "Vaccination Management System" is used to evaluate data from all facets of healthcare systems and to identify the disease variants that affected patients are carrying.
2. By updating the database with the list of medications that can treat a patient with a specific variant, this system also keeps track of the pharmaceuticals administered to patients who have that variant.
3. This approach aids in sending variant compounds and molecules to research labs for more investigation by maintaining statistical data of all the active substances that are successful in targeting a particular variant (say alpha).
4. If a patient is found to have a variant that is known to exist in the database, the patient is given a specific regimen of medications that are effective in curing that variant.
5. If the patient is detected with a Variant that is not present the records, it is treated as a new Variant and the drugs effective on this variant are processed through clinical trails in laboratory.

### Business Approach:

1. Disease combines linked data from several healthcare organizations in order to create vaccinations and medications to treat a specific Variant.
2. to concentrate on the discovery, production, and distribution of novel drugs and vaccines for the worldwide treatment of individuals suffering from a novel disease variant.
3. The vaccine industry keeps track of emerging disease variants and how they target certain molecules that aid in producing antibodies for a particular variant. By combining existing variants in this way, a vaccine maker can produce a new vaccine as soon as a new variant is discovered, preventing any delays in vaccine production.
4. The Project also offers a graphic representation of the number of vaccines produced for a specific City.
5. The project also has features like email prescription that improve the users' user experience.

### Conclusion:

1. This study found that updating the healthcare value system and adopting a specific global data gathering standard will benefit the ecosystem and lead to future advances in patient care.
2. By using the ecosystem method, millions of patients nationwide can receive healthcare that is both efficient and affordable.
3. Inventory tracking across numerous businesses makes it possible to get immunizations and medications to afflicted individuals more quickly.
4. It will also make it easier for us to monitor patients who have novel variants.
